# plant-disease-detection-using-cnn
**🌿 Plant Disease Detection Using CNN**
This project aims to detect plant diseases from leaf images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained on a categorized dataset of healthy and diseased plant leaves and can be deployed using Streamlit for real-time predictions.

**📁 Project Structure**
Dataset Folder: Contains categorized images under train, test, and validation subfolders.
Plant_Disease_App Folder: Contains Python files and Streamlit UI to run the application.

**🚀 How to Run the Project**
Download the complete project from the Google Drive link shared in the GitHub repository.
Place the downloaded folders on your Desktop.

**Open a terminal and navigate to the Plant_Disease_App directory:**
cd Desktop/Plant_Disease_App
**Run the Streamlit app:**
streamlit run app.py
